<b>7/10</b>

'The AI Economy' is an optimistic, whistlestop tour of some possibilities of what increased amounts of automation and autonomy will do to our lives. If you are expecting a detailed economic analysis of some of these effects, you will not get this in this book, which is unfortunate considering the calibre of Bootle's scientific mind. However, the ideas and surface-level analyses that Bootle does present are quite interesting, particularly for those that aren't as economics-literate like me. For example, wealth distribution and inequality (e.g., universal basic income), increasing productivity and growth, deflation of salaries through reduced labour costs and increased competition, and inflation of AI-related goods and services (e.g., salaries, hardware, software) due to high demand. Bootle also stresses the importance of the government in monitoring the AI landscape in terms of education, innovation, regulation, and labour. In terms of future industries, obviously AI-related skills are critical, but he also presents the case for the growth of industries like travel, tourism, and leisure, as his optimistic view bolsters his confidence that our AI-augmented future will involve more people with more spare time and money. Overall, I recommended this book to read, although if you would like more detailed analysis of some of these topics, perhaps you should supplement it with another source.
